# level-set_dealii
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a level set method using the deal.II finite element library. The reinitialization of the level set function is performed via closest point projection onto the interface, followed by a tangential correction step to improve accuracy near the zero level set. Finally, the signed distance function is computed with a direct procedure that finds the closest point on the surface for each point of the grid. This search is performed with a KD-Tree algorithm, in particular using the implementation given in https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann.git.
